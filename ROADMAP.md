## Planned Features ðŸ“‹

### Phase 1: Architectural Cleanup (Priority 1)

#### Python-to-JavaScript Data Pipeline
- Replace brittle kwargs-based data passing between Python reporting layer and React/JS layer
- Design a type-safe, versioned data contract between backend and frontend
- Implement proper serialization/deserialization with validation
- Consider using Protocol Buffers or JSON Schema for data structure definition
- Ensure backward compatibility during migration

### Phase 2: Mobile Experience (Priority 2)

#### Responsive Design
- Implement responsive chart rendering
- Create mobile-optimized templates
- Add server-side rendering for complex visualizations
- Support touch gestures for chart interaction
- Optimize data transfer for mobile networks
- Progressive web app (PWA) capabilities

### Phase 3: Architecture Improvements (Priority 3)

#### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel CSV processing for multi-file imports
- Caching for large datasets beyond API responses
- Incremental report updates

#### Dependency Injection Refinement
- Complete DI container implementation
- Remove remaining static dependencies
- Improve testability with better mocking

#### Cross-Platform Issue Link Service
- Abstract issue URL construction into a dedicated service
- Support multiple project management platforms (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, etc.)
- Configurable URL patterns per platform
- Auto-detect platform from issue key format
- Enable deep linking to issues across different tools

### Phase 4: Work Classification System

#### Opreto Work Type Methodology
- Implement 7-type classification:
  - New Functionality (50-60% target)
  - Technical Debt (15-20% target)
  - Maintenance & Support (~10% target)
  - Research & Spikes (5-10% target)
  - Experience Work (5-10% target)
  - Platform/Infrastructure (5-10% target)
  - Process & Quality (flexible)
- Work type distribution reports
- Alerts for allocation imbalances
- Historical trend analysis by work type
