## Architectural Documentation

- Any architectural change to the system should be documented in a LADR document in the `docs/architecture` directory of the project. The LADR status should be "ACCEPTED", and it should be simple to understand, and designed for the entire `docs/architecture` directory to provide a historical record of major architectural decisions and their rationale.

## Development Workflow

- Your workflow should be: plan -> design failing tests -> implement -> flesh out tests -> update documentation as appropriate -> commit/push.
