# Storybook Status

## Fixed Issues
1. ✅ Fixed Chart story import error (chartColors and chartLayouts weren't exported properly)
2. ✅ Build process now completes successfully
3. ✅ Added proper CSS configuration with Tailwind directives
4. ✅ Configured CSS variables for design tokens
5. ✅ Updated Tailwind config to support background/foreground color classes

## Current State
- Storybook builds and runs without errors
- Components are displayed but may still need styling adjustments
- Design tokens are properly configured in CSS variables
- Tailwind v4 setup with proper @theme configuration

## Remaining Tasks
1. **Component Styling**: While the build works, components may still appear unstyled. Need to:
   - Verify each component properly uses the design system classes
   - Ensure all Tailwind classes are properly generated
   - Check that CSS variables are being applied correctly

2. **Story Updates**: Need to review and update all stories to:
   - Use the latest component APIs
   - Provide comprehensive examples
   - Include all component variants and states
   - Add proper documentation

3. **Dark Mode Support**: Ensure dark mode works properly with:
   - CSS variables switching correctly
   - Components adapting to color scheme
   - Proper contrast ratios maintained

4. **Interactive Features**: Verify that:
   - Component interactions work (buttons, forms, etc.)
   - Charts render properly with Plotly
   - Select components work with Radix UI

## Access
- Run `npm run storybook` from `apps/storybook` directory
- Or serve the static build: `npx http-server storybook-static -p 6006`

## Notes
- Using Tailwind v4 with new configuration syntax
- Design tokens from @sprint-radar/design-tokens package
- Components in packages/ui/src directory
- Stories alongside components using *.stories.tsx pattern
